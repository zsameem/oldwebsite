# About me

I am an undergraduate engineering student at [National Institute of Technology Srinagar](www.nitsri.net). I am majoring
in Information Technology. I was a vistiting student at the [Visual Computing Center](https://vcc.kaust.edu.sa/)  of 
the wonderful [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology](https://kaust.edu.sa/)where I worked with 
[Prof. Ganesh Sundaramoorthi](https://sites.google.com/site/ganeshsun/). I am broadly interested in the field of 
Machine Learning and its applications in Computer Vision.
